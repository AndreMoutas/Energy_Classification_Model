        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.&#xA;&#xA;It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.">

        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly.

        explanation="Apps targeting Android 12 and higher are required to specify an explicit value for `android:exported` when the corresponding component has an intent filter defined. Otherwise, installation will fail.&#xA;&#xA;Previously, `android:exported` for components without any intent filters present used to default to `false`, and when intent filters were present, the default was `true`. Defaults which change value based on other values are confusing and lead to apps accidentally exporting components as a side-effect of adding intent filters. This is a security risk, and we have made this change to avoid introducing accidental vulnerabilities.&#xA;&#xA;While the default without intent filters remains unchanged, it is now required to explicitly specify a value when intent filters are present. Any app failing to meet this requirement will fail to install on any Android version after Android 11.&#xA;&#xA;We recommend setting `android:exported` to false (even on previous versions of Android prior to this requirement) unless you have a good reason to export a particular component."
