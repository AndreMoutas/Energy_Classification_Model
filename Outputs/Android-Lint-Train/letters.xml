        summary="AllowBackup/FullBackupContent Problems"
        explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup&#xA;&#xA;By default, this flag is set to `true` which means application data can be backed up and restored by the OS. Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts the application out of being backed up and so users can&apos;t restore data related to it when they go through the device setup wizard.&#xA;&#xA;Allowing backups may have security consequences for an application. Currently `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.&#xA;&#xA;If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` to configure auto backup."

        summary="Overdraw: Painting regions more than once"
        explanation="If you set a background drawable on a root view, then you should use a custom theme where the theme background is null. Otherwise, the theme background will be painted first, only to have your custom background completely cover it; this is called &quot;overdraw&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;NOTE: This detector relies on figuring out which layouts are associated with which activities based on scanning the Java code, and it&apos;s currently doing that using an inexact pattern matching algorithm. Therefore, it can incorrectly conclude which activity the layout is associated with and then wrongly complain that a background-theme is hidden.&#xA;&#xA;If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.&#xA;&#xA;Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead."
