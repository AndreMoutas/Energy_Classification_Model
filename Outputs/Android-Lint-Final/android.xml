        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.&#xA;&#xA;It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.">

        summary="Unspecified `android:exported` in manifest"
        explanation="Apps targeting Android 12 and higher are required to specify an explicit value for `android:exported` when the corresponding component has an intent filter defined. Otherwise, installation will fail.&#xA;&#xA;Previously, `android:exported` for components without any intent filters present used to default to `false`, and when intent filters were present, the default was `true`. Defaults which change value based on other values are confusing and lead to apps accidentally exporting components as a side-effect of adding intent filters. This is a security risk, and we have made this change to avoid introducing accidental vulnerabilities.&#xA;&#xA;While the default without intent filters remains unchanged, it is now required to explicitly specify a value when intent filters are present. Any app failing to meet this requirement will fail to install on any Android version after Android 11.&#xA;&#xA;We recommend setting `android:exported` to false (even on previous versions of Android prior to this requirement) unless you have a good reason to export a particular component."

        message="On SDK version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up and restored on app install. Consider adding the attribute `android:fullBackupContent` to specify an `@xml` resource which configures which files to backup, or just set `android:fullBackupOnly=true`.

        category="Security"

        summary="AllowBackup/FullBackupContent Problems"
        explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at https://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup&#xA;&#xA;By default, this flag is set to `true` which means application data can be backed up and restored by the OS. Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts the application out of being backed up and so users can&apos;t restore data related to it when they go through the device setup wizard.&#xA;&#xA;Allowing backups may have security consequences for an application. Currently `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.&#xA;&#xA;If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` or `android:fullBackupOnly` to configure auto backup."
