        summary="Obsolete custom lint check"
        explanation="Lint can be extended with &quot;custom checks&quot;: additional checks implemented by developers and libraries to for example enforce specific API usages required by a library or a company coding style guideline.&#xA;&#xA;The Lint APIs are not yet stable, so these checks may either cause a performance degradation, or stop working, or provide wrong results.&#xA;&#xA;This warning flags custom lint checks that are found to be using obsolete APIs and will need to be updated to run in the current lint environment.&#xA;&#xA;It may also flag issues found to be using a **newer** version of the API, meaning that you need to use a newer version of lint (or Android Studio or Gradle plugin etc) to work with these checks.">

        id="ScopedStorage"
        severity="Warning"
        message="WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE no longer provides write access when targeting Android 10+"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="8"
        summary="Affected by scoped storage"
        explanation="Scoped storage is enforced on Android 10+ (or Android 11+ if using `requestLegacyExternalStorage`). In particular, `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` will no longer provide write access to all files; it will provide the equivalent of `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` instead.&#xA;&#xA;The `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission can be used to manage all files, but it is rarely necessary and most apps on Google Play are not allowed to use it. Most apps should instead migrate to use scoped storage. To modify or delete files, apps should request write access from the user as described at https://goo.gle/android-mediastore-createwriterequest.&#xA;&#xA;To learn more, read these resources: Play policy: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-help Allowable use cases: https://goo.gle/policy-storage-usecases"

        summary="Attribute unused on older versions"
        explanation="This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with the `minSdkVersion` attribute).&#xA;&#xA;This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute. However, if the attribute is important to the appearance or functionality of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer attribute.&#xA;&#xA;Note: This check does not only apply to attributes. For example, some tags can be unused too, such as the new `&lt;tag>` element in layouts introduced in API 21."
